# Orbit

Orbit turns business SOPs into governed, executable, observable agents.

Orbit preserves business process intent, executes approved workflows deterministically, and records evidence for every material action.

```text
Natural-language SOP
  -> SOP Graph
  -> Agent IR
  -> Controlled execution
  -> Events and artifacts
  -> Watchtower evidence
```

## Current status

Orbit is currently implementing **Phase 1: Deterministic Proof Loop**.

The initial vertical slice is intentionally narrow:

```text
Watchtower manual trigger
  -> Service request number input
  -> Immutable Agent Version
  -> Deterministic Playwright execution
  -> Screenshots, DOM snapshots, and trace
  -> Watchtower evidence view
```

## Initial demo workflow

### Find Service Request

1. Open the service request portal.
2. Search for the service request using its request number and confirm that the matching request and current status are displayed.

Example input:

```text
SR-1001
```

Expected output:

```text
Request status: In Progress
Assigned team: Infrastructure Operations
Business outcome: request_found
```

An unknown request such as `SR-9999` should complete with the valid business outcome `request_not_found`, not a technical failure.

## Prerequisites

Expected local prerequisites:

- Node.js LTS
- pnpm
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Git

Exact supported versions should be added when the project scaffold is created.

## Local setup

> The commands below are target commands. Verify package scripts after implementation and update this section if the final commands differ.

```bash
pnpm install
docker compose up -d
pnpm db:migrate
pnpm dev
```

Expected local services:

| Service | Expected local address | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Watchtower web app | `http://localhost:3000` | Trigger and inspect runs |
| API | `http://localhost:3002` | Agent/run/evidence API |
| Demo portal | `http://localhost:3001/requests` | Controlled service-request target |
| PostgreSQL | `localhost:5432` | Metadata, run state, events |

## Validation commands

```bash
pnpm typecheck
pnpm lint
pnpm test
pnpm test:e2e
```

## Phase 1 scope

Included:

- Watchtower manual trigger.
- One agent: Find Service Request.
- One typed dynamic input: `requestNumber`.
- Deterministic Playwright browser actions.
- PostgreSQL-backed Agent Versions, runs, steps, events, and artifact metadata.
- Local artifact storage for screenshots, DOM snapshots, and traces.
- Controlled business outcomes: `request_found`, `request_not_found`.
- Read-only controlled demo portal.

Not included:

- Document upload, OCR, PDF/DOCX parsing, screenshot extraction.
- Runtime LLM decisions or recovery.
- Studio authoring UI and workflow graph canvas.
- External websites, real credentials, MFA, or CAPTCHA.
- API/webhook/schedule triggers.
- Redis/BullMQ/Temporal, cloud deployment, S3, Kubernetes, or microservices.
- Multi-tenancy, SSO, full RBAC, policy UI, or approval workflow.
- State-changing business actions.

## Documentation

Read these files in order:

1. [`CLAUDE.md`](./CLAUDE.md) — active engineering rules and Phase 1 constraints.
2. `docs/product/orbit-product-vision-and-requirements.md` — active requirements and acceptance criteria.
3. `docs/product/orbit-end-to-end-delivery-phases.md` — product phases and phase gates.
4. `docs/product/orbit-end-to-end-production-vision.md` — long-term product and production architecture.
5. `docs/architecture/decisions.md` — active architecture decisions.
6. `docs/sop/find-service-request.md` — initial natural-language SOP.
7. `fixtures/find-service-request.agent.yaml` — initial Agent IR fixture.

## Contribution workflow

1. Read `CLAUDE.md` and the active phase requirements.
2. Create or select one bounded task.
3. Propose the approach, affected files, tests, and acceptance criteria.
4. Obtain approval for architecture, contract, data model, or security changes.
5. Implement the smallest complete change.
6. Run relevant checks and tests.
7. Update docs if a contract or setup command changed.
8. Commit a working increment.

## Security notice

Phase 1 uses only a local, read-only demo portal. Do not add real credentials, customer data, production targets, secrets, or unrestricted browser access without explicit scope change and security review.
